The goal of encodeR is to build new …

## Installation

You can install the development version of EncodeR like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(encodeR)
## basic example code
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
